// TODO: Card tracking system
- Implement the system that keeps track of which cards have been discovered.
Feed the discovered cards into the renderer and make the discovered cards render
facing upwards.

- // FIX: The first cards to be added to the completedStacks are hidden when more are added.
- Most likely in the render function.

// FIX: Sometimes cards just dissapear into the void.
- Check if there is a repeating pattern here.

// TODO: Implement shuffleStack
- Implement the shufflestack and the logic associated with it.

// TODO: Implement gamelogic
- Add checks to ensure that the rules of solirate are upheld and 
allow for game completion.
